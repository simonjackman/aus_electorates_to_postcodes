# aus_electorates_to_postcodes
We derive the correspondence between NSW legislative districts and postcodes via a spatial merge, using the G-NAF and a MapInfo file of district boundaries from the NSW Electoral Commission.  We also provide an interactive tabular summary and map of the correspondence.
